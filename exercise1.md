The language picked was Ruby, the most popular linting tool for Ruby is rubocop which is a style checker and formatter based on the Ruby Style Guide, a community oriented guide on the best practices to write and maintain ruby code. The most popular testing tool in Ruby is RSpec which was created for Behavior Driven Development. Ruby doesn't need a build tool since it's a interpreted language.

There are a bunch of CI tools besides Jenkins and Github Actions, like CircleCI, Gitlab CI, Bamboo, TeamCity and many others.  Circle CI is cloud-based tool that is easy to setup and can automate installation and delivery processes, and also can automate tests and commits to build execution. Gitlab CI is a self hosted platform built in Gitlab which provides complete git repository management and control, and also provides application performance monitoring. Bamboo is a tool that is easy to use and perform automatic builds, tests and releases. TeamCity is a CI server that can be used either as a cloud service or self hosted server, very known  of 
its ease of use and integration which allows build and test before the changes are committed.

It would be better in a cloud-based environment because it's easier to maintain in a small team. The information needed to choose between cloud and self hosted servers would be the size and experience of the team, the size of the project, the costs and how important is the security of that whole application.
